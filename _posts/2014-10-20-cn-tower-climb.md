## 2014 United Way CN Tower Climb

My company entered this year's 2014 United Way CN Tower Climb as a corporate team.

"She's so going to die," my beloved husband quipped the night before.  We were having dinner at the in-laws'.  

"Don't say that!"  I have a kind mother-in-law.

"Last time we did this, she hasn't had kids.  We were living on the 30th floor.  We trained for a month, climbing from ground floor back to our condo every day with laptop bag in tow.  And it was _killing_ us last time.  This time, she has effectively no training."

My husband was playing devil's advocate.  He was also stating the truth.

I climbed the CN Tower once.  It was seven years ago.  I was exercising regularly.  I didn't have the baby weight which never left.
