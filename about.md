I am a software developer at Genesys.  

Outside of work, I have a weak resistence to crafting, reading, quality tea and coffee, gaming.  And of course, chocolate.

I am not addicted to exercising, but we get along. 

### Technologies

I primarily work with Java in back end and JavaScript (mostly DHTMLX and AngularJS) on front end.

In my prior lives, I have dabbled with Perl, Python, Ruby, and C/C++.

### Crafts

My main outlet of creativity is knitting and other yarn-related activities.  Check [my Raverly account](http://www.ravelry.com/people/ckpwong) for some of my projects and inspirations.

I also dabble with sewing on older/vintage machines.  My current sewing machines are Singer Touch & Sew 648, Singer Featherweight 221-1 and Singer 201k.  All of them are older than me.  Only the Touch & Sew is younger than my mom.

### Reading

My bookshelves, physical and electronic, are mostly filled with non-fiction.  Permanent favourites include technology, business and crafting.  Started getting into history and stoicism.  There's also a collection of parenting books.

### Caffeinated Drinks

My coffee setup includes a [Hario ceramic coffee mill](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001802PIQ?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B001802PIQ&linkCode=shr&tag=cinscor-20&linkId=CLIE3KGGZUYUMIAM&qid=1413822639&sr=8-1&keywords=hario+hand+grinder) and an [Aeropress](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B0047BIWSK&linkCode=shr&tag=cinscor-20&linkId=S5NLNW5A6AYGFZTZ&=kitchen&qid=1413822723&sr=1-1&keywords=aeropress).  Quality coffee for under $60 worth of investment.  I get my coffee beans from local roasters.  I used to drink with cream and sugar, but have recently switched to black.

Hong Kong style milk tea and Chinese teas are the favourites in our household.  For a little English-ness, I drink Earl Grey with honey.

### StarCraft

I am an avid follower of the professional StarCraft scene.  My current favourite player is [StarTale Life](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Life).  

Yes, I am a Zerg sympatheizer.

### Chocolate

Chocolate makes everything taste better.  My favourite is from the local SOMA Chocolate.  Their Mayan Chocolate (drinking) is absolutely fantastic.

In general I prefer chocolate at about 60-75% cocoa content.
